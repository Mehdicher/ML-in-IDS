# the application of machine learning algorithms in intrusion detection ""ML-in-IDS""
I aim to develop an Intrusion Detection System capable of learning from data, adapting to new threats, and providing more accurate detection.

KNN, Decision Tree, SVM , Random Forest
This is an implementation of Ml algorithms from scratch with the NSL-KDD Dataset 
I used KNN, Decision Tree, SVM and Random Forest models to train the NSL-KDD Dataset
